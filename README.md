# Mancala Game

## Description
[Mancala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala) is a two-player turn based game.
This is a Java implementation of it developed using Spring Boot.
Every game session and their states are stored in in-memory H2 database.

There two endpoints available on the backend:
 - Creating the game session: ```/api/v1/game/create```
 - Moving stones from a chosen pit: ```/api/v1/game/play```

React is used to create the user interface of this game.
Since game state changes after every turn it is appropriate to use a framework like React to minimize the need for writing code.

## Game Play

## Installation
In order to run the backend application at least JDK 11 is required. For the frontend, make sure to use the latest version of Node to get better performance.
To start up the application on your local machine, select ```local``` maven profile and run ```mvn:clean install```.
After build success click run on your IDE.  Alternatively, you can achieve the same by executing this maven goal ```mvn spring-boot:run -Plocal```.
After Spring Boot application starts, you need to start up the React application by simply running ```npm start``` under ```/src/main/frontend``` directory. 

In local environments, backend is accessible only from the origin ```http://localhost:3000``` which is the default local address for React applications. 
If you want to change this default behaviour you need to modify the property ```jurengis.com.mancala.cors.allowed-origins``` in the [application-local.yaml](./src/main/resources/application-local.yaml) file.

---
### Docker Support
To start up the application, run ```mvn clean instal``` first and do following:
```
# set the environment variable beforehand
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=local (Linux and Mac)
$env:SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE='local' (Windows)

# build and run the containers in the background
docker-compose up -d --build
```
---

After both backend and frontend run successfully, you can play the game by opening [localhost](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
